                    I remember the first time I met you. It was in this cramped up classroom in Aakash during some orientation. You seemed like a very simple, easy friend I could make. Our moms met, and we were both happy to have found someone in the middle of the chaos we were dumped into. ðŸ¦™

                <p class="mt-4">
                    I was pretty surprised by the number of girls there were in the first class, and we somehow ended up partially in the same friend group and kept interacting. I realized then that I was wrong about how social I thought you were. You were the silent but smiley type of person.

                    NPS flew by, mostly 'cause I don't want to remember much from those years. I was so excited to be friends with you and Indu when I first joined and I still remember the shock on your face when you first saw me in the assembly. In school, I thought you were this cool, efficient, OCD-type of girl, and compared to my tardy personality, yours felt like a calming presence. You've grounded my big cheerful, loud side. ðŸ¦™

                    JEE happened, and I had never imagined us going to the same college. But, it happened, and it felt insane. I definitely expected you to end up in a much better college. It was so nice to have you and Niyati by my side. From the first day our paths crossed yet again when you moved to CSE.

                    Oh please gods! I remember the 'hangout' we went on, bunking Design Thinking before you moved. Piyush and Mri__ (I can't even remember his name), I can't possibly think of a more awkward experience I've had in my life! We didn't even want to take our masks off. You can be pretty social, you know? You just needed a little push sometimes. ðŸ¦™

                    College was a rollercoaster ride for me, you, everyone. I've learned a lot, changed a lot, been hurt and fooled a lot, and also hurt people a lot. I'm glad I got to experience that part of my life with you. I'm not all that ready to just say goodbye yet.

                    We faced a lot of hurdles during the mini & final year project, and those memories are still fresh in my mind.
